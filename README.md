AI. First, it stole your job. Now, it's stealing your joy.

# What is it?
SetupRoaster is a web app that roasts an image of your computer setup, using Google's Gemini API.
It uses base64 encoding to upload an image to Gemini through Node.js, which then sends a response back to the frontend, allowing you to see the response.

# Why use it?
Sometimes people don't realize how bad they put together their computer setups.
Sometimes they need a reality check.
SetupRoaster will help with that.
